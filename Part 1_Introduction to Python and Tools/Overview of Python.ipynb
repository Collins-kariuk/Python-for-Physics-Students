    "Python has become one of the most popular programming languages for scientific computing, and for good reason. We won't bother ourselves with the definition of programming languages. Indeed, programming languages constitute their own sub-field within Computer Science, for now, let's focus on the basics. Programming languages, at their core, are tools that allow us to communicate with computers and instruct them to perform specific tasks, and Python is one of the most accessible and versatile of these tools."
