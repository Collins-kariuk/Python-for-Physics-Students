    "Conditional logic is an important part of programming, enabling code to execute based on whether specific conditions are true or false. Hence conditional logic is inherently tied to the concept of Boolean values, which can be either `True` or `False`. It also allows different actions to be taken depending on various conditions. Letâ€™s look at a simple real-life example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Mary plans to go to the beach, but her decision depends on the weather:\n",
    "- If itâ€™s sunny, Mary will head to the beach.\n",
    "- If itâ€™s rainy, sheâ€™ll stay home and watch a movie.\n",
    "- If itâ€™s cloudy, she might still go to the beach but take an umbrella with her.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the weather serves as the condition. If the condition is sunny, the code to send Mary to the beach will run. If itâ€™s rainy, the code for staying home and watching a movie will execute. Additional scenarios, like cloudy weather, can be handled with extra conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In programming, this logic can be implemented using if, else, and elif statements:\n",
    "- `if`: Checks a condition and runs code if itâ€™s true.\n",
    "- `else`: Executes a default block of code if the if condition isnâ€™t met.\n",
    "- `elif`: Adds more conditions to handle additional scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conditional logic helps programs make decisions __dynamically__, just like Mary deciding what to do based on the weather."
