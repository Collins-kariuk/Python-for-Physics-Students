Python automatically assigns (or infers) the data type to the variable based on the type of value it is assigned. This is in contrast to statically typed languages like C, C++, Java, etc., where you have to declare the type of a variable when you declare it. This makes Python flexible and beginner-friendly while still being powerful for complex tasks."
