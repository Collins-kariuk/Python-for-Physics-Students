    "Imagine you’re running a small Circle Factory that produces circular plates of various sizes. Your job is to calculate the area of each plate so customers know how much material they’ll need. At first, it’s simple—you write the formula for the area of a circle ($\\pi r^2$) directly into your program every time you need it. This works fine when you only have a few plates to calculate.\n",
    "\n",
    "But soon, business booms! You’re flooded with orders for plates of different sizes. Every time you calculate the area, you find yourself copying and pasting the same formula into different parts of your code. It’s repetitive, error-prone, and frustrating.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, a brilliant idea hits you: _Why not create a single function that calculates the area of a circle?_ You could write this once, call it calculate_area, and reuse it every time you need to find the area of a plate. Suddenly, your factory runs more smoothly. With just one function, you can handle any number of orders efficiently and accurately.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, whenever an order comes in, you simply call the function with the radius of the plate.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this approach, your code is cleaner, easier to read, and far less repetitive. You’ve not only optimized your workflow but also created a reusable tool that saves time and reduces mistakes.\n",
